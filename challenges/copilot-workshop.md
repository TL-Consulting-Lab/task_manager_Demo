# GitHub Copilot Workshop - Task Manager Challenge Exercises

Welcome to the Task Manager Copilot Workshop!
This session is designed to help you explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot by implementing features and improvements in a simple task manager application.

Use GitHub Copilot Chat, inline suggestions, and Copilot Agents (if available) to complete each challenge. Collaborate, explore, and experiment!

## Basic Exercises

1. **Add Task Categories**
   - Modify the backend to support task categories
   - Add a category field to tasks

>> "Add a category field to the task schema"

2. **Add Due Date Functionality**
   - Use Copilot to generate a function that:
>> "Generate a function for adding Due Dates functionality to tasks"

3. **Write Unit Tests for Due Date Logic**
>> "Generate  unit tests for due dates functionality"

4. **Generate Documentation**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to create various types of documentation to improve clarity and collaboration:

    Project Setup
>> "Generate setup instructions for running the app"

    Code Comments
>> "Add inline and JSDoc comments to explain this function"

    API Documentation
>> "Document API endpoints including request/response examples"

    Development Notes
>> "Create CONTRIBUTING.md with developer guidelines"

5. **Explain code**
    - Use Copilot Chat or Agent to understand unfamiliar code or suggest improvements.

>>  “What does this function do?”
>>  “Suggest improvements to this code.”
>> "Explain the code to me in High level"

6. **Generate workflow diagram**
   - Describe the flow from task creation to rendering on screen 

>> /Create a workflow diagram for how a task is created and displayed
    - You can use Ctrl+Shift+V (in Markdown preview) to view diagrams.

7. **Run the application**
   - Copilot will start both the backend and frontend servers.
   - Ask for help with common errors if something doesn't work.

>> "How do I run both backend and frontend servers?"
>> "Help me debug this error when starting the server."

8. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Learn how to create and manage pull requests with Copilot's help
   - Get guidance on writing good PR descriptions
   - Learn about PR best practices

>> "Help me create a pull request for my changes"
>> "What should I include in my PR description?"
>> "How do I update my PR with the latest changes?"
>> "Push the changes to remote"

## Advanced Exercises

9. **Implement Task Search and Filtering**
   - Add a search function to filter tasks by title, description, or category
   - Implement advanced filtering options (due date range, status, etc.)
   - Add sorting capabilities

>> "Help me implement a search function for tasks"
>> "Add filters for task status and due date"

10. **Task Dependencies and Subtasks**
   - Allow tasks to have subtasks
   - Implement task dependencies (tasks that must be completed before others)
   - Add validation logic for circular dependencies

>> "Add subtask functionality to the task schema"
>> "Help me implement task dependency validation"

11. **Advanced Testing**
    - Write integration tests for task workflows
    - Add performance benchmarks
    - Implement end-to-end tests
    - Add API load testing

>> "Generate integration tests for the task workflow"
>> "Help me write performance benchmark tests"

12. **Error Handling and Validation**
    - Implement comprehensive error handling
    - Add input validation with detailed error messages
    - Create a custom error handling middleware
    - Add error logging and monitoring

>> "Implement better error handling for task operations"
>> "Add validation for task input fields"

13. **CI/CD and Automation**
    - Set up GitHub Actions workflow
    - Implement automated testing
    - Add automated deployment
    - Create release management process

>> "Help me set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"
>> "Create an automated deployment workflow"

Remember to:
- Use Git version control effectively
- Write clear commit messages
- Document any configuration changes
- Update API documentation for new features
- Consider backwards compatibility
- Follow security best practices

These advanced exercises will help you explore more complex scenarios and learn how GitHub Copilot can assist with sophisticated development tasks.

Each exercise includes:
- Backend API changes
- Frontend UI updates
- Additional tests
- Documentation updates

Choose exercises based on your skill level and learning goals. Start with basic exercises and progress to more advanced ones as you become comfortable with the codebase.
