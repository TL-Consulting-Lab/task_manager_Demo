# GitHub Copilot Workshop - Task Manager Challenge Exercises

Welcome to the Task Manager Copilot Workshop!
This session is designed to help you explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot by implementing features and improvements in a simple task manager application.

Use GitHub Copilot Chat, inline suggestions, and Copilot Agents (if available) to complete each challenge. Collaborate, explore, and experiment!

## Basic Exercises

1. **Add Task Categories**
   - Modify the backend to support task categories
   - Add a category field to tasks

   >> "Add a category field to the task schema"

2. **Add Due Date Functionality**
   - Use Copilot to generate a function that:
   >> "Generate a function for adding Due Dates functionality to tasks"

3. **Write Unit Tests for Due Date Logic**
   >> "Generate  unit tests for due dates functionality"

4. **Generate Documentation**
   - Use GitHub Copilot to create various types of documentation to improve clarity and collaboration:

    Project Setup
   >> "Generate setup instructions for running the app"

    Code Comments
   >> "Add inline and JSDoc comments to explain this function"

    API Documentation
   >> "Document API endpoints including request/response examples"

    Development Notes
   >> "Create CONTRIBUTING.md with developer guidelines"

5. **Explain code**
    - Use Copilot Chat or Agent to understand unfamiliar code or suggest improvements.

   >>  “What does this function do?”
   >>  “Suggest improvements to this code.”
   >> "Explain the code to me in High level"

6. **Generate workflow diagram**
   - Describe the flow from task creation to rendering on screen 

    >> /Create a workflow diagram for how a task is created and displayed
    - You can use Ctrl+Shift+V (in Markdown preview) to view diagrams.

7. **Run the application**
   - Copilot will start both the backend and frontend servers.
   - Ask for help with common errors if something doesn’t work.

   >> “How do I run both backend and frontend servers?”
   >> “Help me debug this error when starting the server.”

Each exercise includes:
- Backend API changes
- Frontend UI updates
- Additional tests
- Documentation updates

Choose exercises based on your skill level and learning goals. Start with basic exercises and progress to more advanced ones as you become comfortable with the codebase.
